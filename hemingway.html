        He was part of the “Lost Generation” of writers and became one of the most influential authors of the 20th century.  
        His adventurous life—from war correspondent to big-game hunter—inspired much of his work.

        Hemingway won the <strong>Nobel Prize in Literature</strong> in 1954 and the <strong>Pulitzer Prize</strong> in 1953 for
